    "text": "arXiv Preprint | Code\nOver the centuries, I have devoted countless hours to deciphering and translating the ancient scripts and dialects of the various peoples of Middle-earth. My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."

I am also the Director for the Center of Economic Excellence.\nBefore I entered graduate school for economics, I taught mathematics and astrononmy at Front Range Community College. I still think astronomy is cool. Before that, I taught high school math.\nMy research focuses on risky behaviors and public policy. Most recently, I have been studying the impact of cannabis liberalization. I think there are some unanswered questions concerning the substitutability of alcohol and cannabis in social versus medicinal situations. While casual inference is, and always will be, the goal; I’m not one to walk away from null results or the simple measurement of effects.\nI am very passionate about teaching. I believe in a student-centered, classroom experience that focuses on critical thinking and open discussions. I eschew long-format lectures for shorter modules punctuated with deep dives into concepts through a socratic format."
